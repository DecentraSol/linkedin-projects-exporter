# linkedin-projects-exporter

This is a NodeJS project which is connecting to the LinkedInAPI, generates an AccessCode and with this an AccessToken.
It is possible to retrieve the personal information such as my name. Obviously this is not much and I 
found out it is necessary to became LinkedIn Partner to get more information from the API.

You maybe read this blog and try and let me know if that still works - https://www.jcchouinard.com/linkedin-api/
